## 🖥️✨ Hello World! I'm Bàrbara 👋

With a hybrid vision between digital design (UI/UX) and frontend development, I am passionate about moving between the creative and technical sides, exploring how design and programming can work together to transform ideas and needs into functional, accessible digital products with personality, combining creativity, utility, and code. 

Currently, while honing my programming and frontend development skills, I enjoy learning and discovering how design can come to life through code and become real implementations. I also believe in well-thought-out projects, in the details that make a difference, and in collaboration between creative and technical profiles.

⚡ Fun fact: If you don't find me designing and programming, you can find me among books and a cup of chai latte 📚☕️
